## üìù General Information
Here's a project in the Unreal Engine 4 written in C++. In the game, the player can interactively open and close a crate. Once the crate is opened, a ball shoots out with an additional effect showing its flight trajectory. The player can pick up each ejected ball, which automatically appears in their right hand. Subsequently, the player can throw the ball in any chosen direction.

Additionally, artificial intelligence has been implemented in the game. It observes when the player throws the ball. Upon detection of the throw, the AI reacts by running towards the ball to pick it up. Then, the AI returns with the ball to the player to hand it over.
